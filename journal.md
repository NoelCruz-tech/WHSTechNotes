Reflecting back on last semester the most enjoyable thing about the class I was in is that I was ablw to work with groups and code. The one thing that can be improved is to be better at coding. As we start the semester I would like to learn and understand coding a little bit more, I feel like im struggling on coding a bit and I would like to understand it more. There are certifications I would like, I would like python. To support me achieve this goal I would need to practice in my own time.

I think that the shift that the tech company is going towards has 2 things, good and bad. Good because AI can replace traditional tech roles and maybe make them better. The bad part about it is that it could possibly replace the job of the people who are working there. In the article it says that Goldman Sachs will be able to reach $200 billion dollars by 2025 due to the AI skills. Many companies sees this as a good idea so they are also using AI to help the company.

I think this makes a giant impact because if there is like a protest or anything that's bad or good, people would wanna talk about it on tik tok. You would take away the people's voice and the freedom of speech in tik tok, people also get all their news from tik tok and reliable news. Tik tok could address security concerns globally by maybe using apps like twitter, instagram, or google. If I was a tik tok developer a secuirty policy I could do is if someone is hacking your account they would automaticlly lock your account and send a email or message to your account saying that the account is temporarily locked due to someone trying to hack in. I could take this lesson and apply it to my own project to practice privacy for the user or protection from any harm or threats to the user. This relates to the concepts we have covered like app development, we made our own sports game and it worked great.

People can dynamiclly adjust flight paths and scedueling based on real time data. I'm assuming this helps with making the airplane go in a straight path instead of malfunctioning or going in patterns. coding and computer systems could possibly malfunction due to nobody checking on them or maybe there is something wrong with the code. Sometimes people forget to check if anything is wrong with the system or assume that the system is okay and doesn't need to be checked on. Sometimes poor interferance or unclear alerts could possibly happen since they might've not known that they were about to crash into another thing. It didn't seem like they knew if they were gonna crash or not. Hijacking or hacking or cyber vunerability could be the case, sometimes people can hack into anything nowadays if they have enough experince. To prevent further accidents people should moderate these issues even more often and need to check the systems every now and then. And if the systems are good they should do a double check or maybe in scenarios like the one we are disscussing, they should do a triple check.
