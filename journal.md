Reflecting back on last semester the most enjoyable thing about the class I was in is that I was ablw to work with groups and code. The one thing that can be improved is to be better at coding. As we start the semester I would like to learn and understand coding a little bit more, I feel like im struggling on coding a bit and I would like to understand it more. There are certifications I would like, I would like python. To support me achieve this goal I would need to practice in my own time.

I think that the shift that the tech company is going towards has 2 things, good and bad. Good because AI can replace traditional tech roles and maybe make them better. The bad part about it is that it could possibly replace the job of the people who are working there. In the article it says that Goldman Sachs will be able to reach $200 billion dollars by 2025 due to the AI skills. Many companies sees this as a good idea so they are also using AI to help the company.

I think this makes a giant impact because if there is like a protest or anything that's bad or good, people would wanna talk about it on tik tok. You would take away the people's voice and the freedom of speech in tik tok, people also get all their news from tik tok and reliable news. Tik tok could address security concerns globally by maybe using apps like twitter, instagram, or google. If I was a tik tok developer a secuirty policy I could do is if someone is hacking your account they would automaticlly lock your account and send a email or message to your account saying that the account is temporarily locked due to someone trying to hack in. I could take this lesson and apply it to my own project to practice privacy for the user or protection from any harm or threats to the user. This relates to the concepts we have covered like app development, we made our own sports game and it worked great.
