Reflecting back on last semester the most enjoyable thing about the class I was in is that I was ablw to work with groups and code. The one thing that can be improved is to be better at coding. As we start the semester I would like to learn and understand coding a little bit more, I feel like im struggling on coding a bit and I would like to understand it more. There are certifications I would like, I would like python. To support me achieve this goal I would need to practice in my own time.

I think that the shift that the tech company is going towards has 2 things, good and bad. Good because AI can replace traditional tech roles and maybe make them better. The bad part about it is that it could possibly replace the job of the people who are working there. In the article it says that Goldman Sachs will be able to reach $200 billion dollars by 2025 due to the AI skills. Many companies sees this as a good idea so they are also using AI to help the company.
